<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I am currently a ninth grade student attending Sunset Jr.High,my school life is one of my top priorites and I take my education fairly seriously. I work hard to maintain good grades because I know that especially were I want to possibly get a career in the medical field, a good GPA and education will be important in my future. I also, enjoy the social aspect of school and being able to explore my likes and dislikes through my classes, the class i enjoy the most is English because it is one of my strong suits and grows my creativity. My favorite parts of my school life is being able to play on my schools volleyball team and being a member of this years Student Body Office. </p>

<p>I am fourteen years old and I have lived in Clinton, UT since first grade. I have a family of four and one dog named Scout. One of my favorite things to do is play volleyball, i've been playing since seventh grade and it has become something that I truly love to do, either by playing for school, on a club team, or just practicing. I also, really enjoy being social with my friends and family, going on adventures and just having fun! </p>
